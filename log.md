**About Me** 
I've been learning to code for about a month now, I've not really chosen a specific path until now. I have basic understanding of ruby/rails, java, javascript, html, and css.

Im learning to code because I enjoy it, and freelancing is my current goal. I aim to be able to freelance websites, atleast the design portion, by the end of this month.

**The technologies I aim to learn by the end of the 100 days are:**  

#HTML & CSS  

#Javascript  

#Node.js or PHP (leaning towards node)  

#A javascript library, either vue, or react

### Day 1: February 22, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to recap on the basics of javascript before diving into it headfirst and using it on applications. I reviewed variables, functions, and loops. Spent a total of 5 hours making sure that I understand everything adequately. I then decided to take another look at FreeCodeCamp, which I started, and stopped at the tribute page because I had no clue how to even start it. I worked on the tribute page and it took me just over an hour to fully complete it. I didn't make it look amazing, because it's late, and I want to spend the bulk of my time working on the portfolio page which in my opinion is a lot more fun.

**Thoughts:** I struggle with CSS still, however my HTML skills have gotten a lot better. This may be because I have switched to bootstrap, and don't know much about it. I'm a lot better at recreating work from a picture than I was 20 days ago.
