**About Me**  

#### I've been learning to code for about a month now, I've not really chosen a specific path until now. I have basic understanding of ruby/rails, java, javascript, html, and css. I know git/github pretty well, but im horrible at markdown(as you can see).

#### Im learning to code because I enjoy it, and freelancing is my current goal. I aim to be able to freelance websites, atleast the design portion, by the end of this march.

#### My goal daily will be 2-3 hours of focused learning, and will link code that I'm proud of, or helped me after each days entry. I will also include resources that I used and found valuable for future use, or whoever reads this.

**The technologies I aim to learn by the end of the 100 days are:**  

+ HTML & CSS, I have made 2 quality websites. They were code alongs and not my own IP. I want to learn how to do it on my own.  

+ Javascript, This is where I want to spend the bulk of my learning.

+ Learning React is my main goal in this challenge. Hopefully if I achieve this goal that will mean that I learn javascript well.

+ Node.js - This will be the last thing I go in to. I will learn the basics early on, and not much else. I don't think this is an important library to learn early on due to it not really effecting the design portion, which I want to dedicate my time to.

### Day 1: February 22, 2018
**Time Spent: 5 hours**
**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to recap on the basics of javascript before diving into it headfirst and using it on applications. I reviewed variables, functions, and loops. Spent a total of 5 hours making sure that I understand everything adequately. I then decided to take another look at FreeCodeCamp, which I started, and stopped at the tribute page because I had no clue how to even start it. I worked on the tribute page and it took me just over an hour to fully complete it. I didn't make it look amazing, because it's late, and I want to spend the bulk of my time working on the portfolio page which in my opinion is a lot more fun.

**Thoughts:** I struggle with CSS still, however my HTML skills have gotten a lot better. This may be because I have switched to bootstrap, and don't know much about it. I'm a lot better at recreating work from a picture than I was 20 days ago.

### Day 2: February 23, 2018
**Time Spent: 5 hours**
**Today's Progress**: Today I spent a lot of time going over html, and more intermediate css concepts and syntax. I designed the nav bar for my personal portfolio, and while it took over 1 hour, it looks nice. I'm feeling like some of the simpler things are clicking which is nice. I spent around 4 hours following Colt Steele's course on udemy. It's teaching my a lot more because all of the concepts he shows you he makes very simple. I reccomend this course to anyone that doesn't know where to start with web development.

### Day 3: February 24, 2018
**Time Spent: 2 hours**
**Today's Progress**: I didn't code much today, 2 hours total. I spent more time on the udemy course. I created a tic tac toe board, and a basic image gallery that I dont fully understand. I intend to go back tommorow and rewatch it. Overall today was slow, but I started to keep notes with a pencil in a notepad in an attempt to retain the information better.

### Day 4: February 25, 2018
**Time Spent: 4.5 hours**
**Today's Progress**: Taking notes has definetly helped me to retain information and will keep the practice going forward. Today I learned a lot more bootstrap. I learned how to make a nav bar, that resizes based on screen size, and when it resizes, a button appears allowing you to view the actions on the bar. I also learned about jumbotrons, and columns. I incorportated everything I learned today into my personal portfolio project for freecodecamp. A picture is attached below. Tommorow I will finish bootstrap section, and move on to javascript while I'm on campus.

### Day 5: February 26, 2018
**Time Spent: 1 hour**
**Today's Progress**: Another day of light coding. Had class twice today so I took it easy. Tommorow I don't have any responsibilities so I'm  going to aim for 8 hours. Today I learned to code a landing page with a nav bar and some buttons. I learned to never make a nav bar ever again and to just copy paste mine.

### Day 6: February 27, 2018
**Time Spent: 7 hours**
**Today's Progress**: Today I coded for 7 hours. While I didn't reach my goal of 8 hours, I think 7 is respectable. I spent ALL of that time learning JavaScript. I learned the ins and outs of the basics again from the udemy course, and pushed a little bit outside into functions and higher order functions. Taking notes has seriously helped me in terms of retaining information, and I review my notes from the day before, before I go to bed, and when I wake up. Tommorow I aim for 4-5 hours, and to finish up the javascript specific section of the course. I didn't work on my portfolio at all as there was nothing I learned today that I can transfer to it in any meaningful way.

### Day 7: February 28, 2018
**Time Spent: 1 hours**
**Today's Progress**: Today was a really shitty day. Had class all day, got home at 3, did econ homework for 2 hours, back to school, and got back at 8:30. Watched tv to wind down then I learned about javascript arrays/functions for an hour and honestly I learned a lot. I didn't know about array.slice(); and shift/unshift. Overall it was a productive hour despite being stoned, writing down notes I retained all of what I learned.
