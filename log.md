**About Me**  

#### I've been learning to code for about a month now, I've not really chosen a specific path until now. I have basic understanding of ruby/rails, java, javascript, html, and css. I know git/github pretty well, but im horrible at markdown(as you can see).

#### Im learning to code because I enjoy it, and freelancing is my current goal. I aim to be able to freelance websites, atleast the design portion, by the end of this april.

#### My goal daily will be 1-4 hours of focused learning, and will link code that I'm proud of, or helped me after each days entry. I will also include resources that I used and found valuable for future use, or whoever reads this.

**The technologies I aim to learn by the end of the 100 days are:**  

+ HTML & CSS, I have made 2 quality websites. They were code alongs and not my own IP. I want to learn how to do it on my own.  

+ Javascript, This is where I want to spend the bulk of my learning.

+ Learning React is my main goal in this challenge. Hopefully if I achieve this goal that will mean that I learned javascript well.

+ Node.js - This will be the last thing I go in to. I will learn the basics early on, and not much else. I don't think this is an important library to learn early on due to it not really effecting the design portion, which I want to dedicate my time to.

### Day 1: February 22, 2018
**Time Spent: 5 hours**

**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to recap on the basics of javascript before diving into it headfirst and using it on applications. I reviewed variables, functions, and loops. Spent a total of 5 hours making sure that I understand everything adequately. I then decided to take another look at FreeCodeCamp, which I started, and stopped at the tribute page because I had no clue how to even start it. I worked on the tribute page and it took me just over an hour to fully complete it. I didn't make it look amazing, because it's late, and I want to spend the bulk of my time working on the portfolio page which in my opinion is a lot more fun.

**Thoughts:** I struggle with CSS still, however my HTML skills have gotten a lot better. This may be because I have switched to bootstrap, and don't know much about it. I'm a lot better at recreating work from a picture than I was 20 days ago.

### Day 2: February 23, 2018
**Time Spent: 5 hours**

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent a lot of time going over html, and more intermediate css concepts and syntax. I designed the nav bar for my personal portfolio, and while it took over 1 hour, it looks nice. I'm feeling like some of the simpler things are clicking which is nice. I spent around 4 hours following Colt Steele's course on udemy. It's teaching my a lot more because all of the concepts he shows you he makes very simple. I reccomend this course to anyone that doesn't know where to start with web development.

### Day 3: February 24, 2018
**Time Spent: 2 hours**

**Today's Progress**: I didn't code much today, 2 hours total. I spent more time on the udemy course. I created a tic tac toe board, and a basic image gallery that I dont fully understand. I intend to go back tommorow and rewatch it. Overall today was slow, but I started to keep notes with a pencil in a notepad in an attempt to retain the information better.

### Day 4: February 25, 2018
**Time Spent: 4.5 hours**

**Today's Progress**: Taking notes has definetly helped me to retain information and will keep the practice going forward. Today I learned a lot more bootstrap. I learned how to make a nav bar, that resizes based on screen size, and when it resizes, a button appears allowing you to view the actions on the bar. I also learned about jumbotrons, and columns. I incorportated everything I learned today into my personal portfolio project for freecodecamp. A picture is attached below. Tommorow I will finish bootstrap section, and move on to javascript while I'm on campus.

### Day 5: February 26, 2018
**Time Spent: 1 hour**

**Today's Progress**: Another day of light coding. Had class twice today so I took it easy. Tommorow I don't have any responsibilities so I'm  going to aim for 8 hours. Today I learned to code a landing page with a nav bar and some buttons. I learned to never make a nav bar ever again and to just copy paste mine.

### Day 6: February 27, 2018
**Time Spent: 7 hours**

**Today's Progress**: Today I coded for 7 hours. While I didn't reach my goal of 8 hours, I think 7 is respectable. I spent ALL of that time learning JavaScript. I learned the ins and outs of the basics again from the udemy course, and pushed a little bit outside into functions and higher order functions. Taking notes has seriously helped me in terms of retaining information, and I review my notes from the day before, before I go to bed, and when I wake up. Tommorow I aim for 4-5 hours, and to finish up the javascript specific section of the course. I didn't work on my portfolio at all as there was nothing I learned today that I can transfer to it in any meaningful way.

### Day 7: February 28, 2018
**Time Spent: 1 hours**

**Today's Progress**: Today was a really shitty day. Had class all day, got home at 3, did econ homework for 2 hours, back to school, and got back at 8:30. Watched tv to wind down then I learned about javascript arrays/functions for an hour and honestly I learned a lot. I didn't know about array.slice(); and shift/unshift. Overall it was a productive hour despite being stoned, writing down notes I retained all of what I learned.

### Day 8: March 1, 2018
**Time Spent: 5 hours 30 minutes**

**Today's Progress**: Finished two sections of the udemy course. Javascript Arrays and Objects. I have a pretty decent understanding on them and what you can do with them. I know how to access nested arrays in an object, and vice versa. The only reason I'm stopping at the moment is because my brain hurts. I feel like I learned a lot today and pushing further will be for nothing. I learned about the this keyword, it references the object that it is contained in. Tommorow I will be going into the dom manipulation portion of the course which I am really excited for because I can put my JavaScript Knowlege to use! Overall I think that my understanding of JavaScript is pretty solid. It is my best language by far. Although I have no idea how to do dom manipulation, I understand all of the basic concepts of the language and I'm looking forward to build off of it.

***Addition***: Did another hour, learned about the DOM. I also learned how to select elements from the html by using things like document.querySelector("p"); and document.getElementsByClassName("class");. Most importantly I learned how to use them and what they specifically do, like querySelector only takes the first matching result, but you can override this by using document.querySelectorAll("p").

### Day 9: March 2, 2018
**Time Spent: 4 hours**

**Today's Progress**: Finished Two sections today, also went to the doctor's and the movies so I'm satisfied with the progress. I learned way more about selecting elements, and different things you can do with them. I learned how to modify the html using javascript to reflect changes in a "score" dynamically.

### Day 10: March 3, 2018
**Time Spent: 4 hours**

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the color game section for 4 hours and finished the section. Seeing what I've practiced go into action was really cool. I think I'm going to stop following the course for today, and instead work on making one of my own projects. This should help me learn to think how to solve problems instead of copying from the guide.

**Addition**  Worked another hour and a half. Got aquainted with jQuery. At first I was skeptical of using it, but after toying around with it for a little bit, I understand why its popular. Avoid for loops is a massive advantage in terms of time saved, but I also worry I might forget normal JS in the long run and that would be upsetting. Overall I still want to learn it but I am still skeptical.


### Day 11: March 4, 2018
**Time Spent: 1 hour 30 minutes**

**Today's Progress**: Finished one section, the advanced jQuery part of the guide. My internet is being really poor at the moment so I'm going to call it for today. I think that on sundays I will only commit an hour of my time, otherwise I'm going to get burnt out. I worked on my personal project for a bit that ended up being a blackjack game. I got the barebones working in JS to play and reset and give a won condition. I didn't want to set up the UI on account of how much I despise html/css. I want to be proficient in Javascript, React, Node, and PHP. I feel as if I enjoyed backend a lot more. I will continue with this course because it is still valuable to learn these skills in the long run.

### Day 12: March 5, 2018
**Time Spent: 1 hour 30 minutes**

**Today's Progress**: Started the todoList project on the udemy course. While going through I'm trying to do what he says hes going to do, before he does it. I am also trying to refactor my code to get it to be the most readable it can. I am also commenting every line so I can fully understand what I'm doing and not just copying what he is doing without thinking. 

**Thoughts-** I really enjoy javascript, typing it is fun, and I really understand what I'm doing enough to the point where I know exactly what to google to solve my issues and implement them. While I really enjoy javascript I do not like HTML and CSS. I am at an intermediate level in them but still have problems sometimes aligning things and its just frustrating because the problems cannot be solved by googling most of the time. I enjoyed backend while I was doing it and currently cannot wait to get back to it. I want to learn Node, then React. After this I plan to learn PHP.
